# Efficient-Algorithms-for-Graph-Analysis-and-Visualization-
Efficient Implementation and Analysis of Graph Algorithms on Large Datasets. Implemented in Java.

-The project requires efficient implementation of various algorithms on a graph dataset with a minimum of 1000 nodes.

-The algorithms include finding single source shortest path using Dijkstra and Bellman Ford, minimum spanning tree using Prims and Kruskals, breadth first and depth first traversal, finding diameter of a graph, and detecting cycle in a graph.

-The implementation should use any programming language and provide a complete trace of the algorithm, as well as store the results in separate files and provide execution time.

-The project should be tested on a graph dataset available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html, with the user selecting any node as a source node for certain problems.

-The report should include machine specifications, complete algorithms with time complexity analysis, details of the dataset, comparison of algorithms using plots/graphs, and discussion of implementation structure and its effect on time complexity.
